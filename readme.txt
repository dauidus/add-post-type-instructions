Allows admins to easily set instructional context for metaboxes and more on pages, posts or custom post types.

== Description ==

Add Post Type Instructions allows admins to easily set instructional context for metaboxes and more on pages, posts or custom post types.  Currently it supports adding instructional context in the following areas on the add/edit screen:
** **
* above the title field
* above the WYSIWYG editor
* default content within the WYSIWYG editor

and within the following metaboxes:
** **
* publish
* author
* featured image
* excerpt
* trackbacks
* custom fields
* page attributes
* categories
* custom categories
* tags
* custom tags
* post format
* discussion
* comments
* revisions
* slug

APTI uses OOP standards to add options only for those metaboxes which are supported for each post type and to execute code only on those pages where it is needed.  It works especially well for sites with many custom post types that require content to be entered in a specific way (ie. when a post type requires a specific page template or when the absence of a featured image will break the intended look of a post).  Think of any theme or plugin that supports an image slider powered by a required featured image, and you can surely see where APTI can come in handy.

To be clear, APTI does absolutely nothing to the front-end of your site.  It simply adds instructional context to the add/edit page/post admin screen so your clients and site editors might better understand how content is to be added.

APTI works with multisite networks and allows users to define settings on a per-site basis.

APTI will work with drag-n-drop builders such as Visual Composer, but the author cannot recommend its use with them.  Due to the proprietary nature of these page builders, this plugin will not officially support them.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Who does this plugin benefit most? =

I wrote this plugin to provide simple assistance for my clients as they publish content.  With just a quick look at any metabox, site managers (authors, editors...) can see a clear description of what will happen when they add content to that metabox.  I have used this to convey the ideal image size for featured images, explain what tags are, or even add default content to any post type.  I have also used this to add consice instructions immediately below the title field on any post type that requires extra careful content editing.  Hopefully, it will benefit both site admins and site managers, as well as editors.

= Does it support Multisite? =

Yes.  This plugin can be either network activated or activated individually for each site on a network.

= How can I delete all data associated with this plugin? =

Simply delete this plugin to remove all data associated with it.  Deactivating the plugin will keep all plugin data saved in the database, but will not remove it.
